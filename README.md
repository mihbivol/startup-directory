# Startup Directory

This project is a web application built using Next.js that serves as a directory for startups. It allows users to browse and potentially search for startups based on various criteria (implementation details would be visible in the code, but this description focuses on the purpose and technologies).  This project demonstrates my ability to build and deploy a full-stack web application using modern JavaScript frameworks and platforms.

**Live Demo:** [https://startup-directory-phi.vercel.app/](https://startup-directory-phi.vercel.app/)

## Description

This Startup Directory project was created as a learning exercise to explore and implement key concepts of Next.js, including server-side rendering, routing, and data fetching.  It showcases my understanding of building dynamic and performant web applications.  While the current version may have a basic feature set, it serves as a foundation for future enhancements, such as adding search functionality, user authentication, and more detailed startup profiles.  This project is a testament to my commitment to learning and applying new technologies in practical projects.

## Technologies Used

*   **Next.js:** A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated applications.  This provides performance benefits and improved SEO.
*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.  Next.js is built on top of React.
*   **JavaScript:** The primary programming language used for the project's logic and interactivity.
*   **HTML/CSS:** Used for structuring and styling the web pages. (Details of CSS framework/methodology can be added here if applicable, e.g., Tailwind CSS, styled-components, etc.)
*   **Vercel:** A cloud platform for deploying and hosting web applications.  This project is deployed and hosted on Vercel.
*   **Git & GitHub:** Used for version control and collaboration.  The project's source code is available on GitHub.

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

This section can be included to show your forward-thinking approach.  You can list potential improvements you'd like to make to the project in the future.  For example:

*   Implement a robust search functionality.
*   Add user authentication and authorization.
*   Create detailed startup profile pages.
*   Integrate with a database to store and manage startup data.
*   Improve the user interface and user experience.
