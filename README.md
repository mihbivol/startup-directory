# Startup Directory

This project is a web application built using Next.js and TypeScript that serves as a directory for startups. It allows users to browse and potentially search for startups based on various criteria (implementation details would be visible in the code, but this description focuses on the purpose and technologies).  This project demonstrates my ability to build and deploy a full-stack web application using modern JavaScript frameworks, platforms, and backend services.

## Description

This Startup Directory project was created as a learning exercise to explore and implement key concepts of Next.js, including server-side rendering, routing, caching and data fetching. It leverages Sanity.io for content management and data storage and Clerk.com for user authentication. It showcases my understanding of building dynamic and performant web applications with integrated backend services. While the current version may have a basic feature set, it serves as a foundation for future enhancements, such as adding search functionality, more detailed startup profiles, and enhanced user features. This project is a testament to my commitment to learning and applying new technologies in practical projects.

## Technologies Used

*   **Next.js:** A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated applications. This provides performance benefits and improved SEO.
*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Next.js is built on top of React.
*   **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code maintainability and reduces errors.
*   **JavaScript:** The primary programming language used for the project's logic and interactivity.
*   **HTML/CSS:** Used for structuring and styling the web pages. (Tailwind CSS, Shadcn, styled-components, etc.)
*   **Sanity.io:** A headless CMS used for backend data storage and management.
*   **Clerk.com:** A platform for user authentication and management.
*   **Vercel:** A cloud platform for deploying and hosting web applications. This project is deployed and hosted on Vercel.
*   **Git & GitHub:** Used for version control and collaboration. The project's source code is available on GitHub.
